# Reminder Pet — Project status & chat handoff

_Last updated: 2026-10-16. This file is canonical and is updated as work is committed._

## Identity
- Repository: `rayadinaveen98-ship-it/reminder-pet`. Keep the GitHub name **reminder-pet**.
- Working product codename: PetPing (not final branding).
- Product promise: a small animated companion announces reminders, offers Done/Snooze and does not require a cloud account.
- Platform order: **Windows desktop first, Android second**. iOS is later and technically restricted.
- Technology: C# / .NET 10 / WPF on Windows; offline local JSON store in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\PetPing`; Windows tray process; system SpeechSynthesizer. Android future: Kotlin/Compose, Room, AlarmManager/notifications.
- No paid APIs or mandatory hosted services for alpha.

## Verified build status
- **v0.6 Windows alpha (CI-verified, manual QA pending):** Windows x64 compilation and **49** core regression checks passed. GitHub CI: https://github.com/rayadinaveen98-ship-it/reminder-pet/actions/runs/38868473793 ; artifact `PetPing-Windows-v0.6-unsigned` (artifact ID 12032022285).
- **v0.5 Windows alpha:** compiled Windows x64 and passed **32** core regression checks. GitHub CI: https://github.com/rayadinaveen98-ship-it/reminder-pet/actions/runs/38864475272 ; artifact: `PetPing-Windows-v0.5-unsigned` (GitHub Actions retention applies).
- **v0.4 user-tested baseline:** compiled and passed 21 core checks. User confirmed the floating character is outside the bubble and shows over ordinary desktop apps. CI: https://github.com/rayadinaveen98-ship-it/reminder-pet/actions/runs/38862763782 .
- User manually confirmed: the pet appears above desktop apps, and in v0.4 the character is outside the notification bubble and works. Whether spoken text is consistently audible remains **unconfirmed**.
- The downloaded build is an **unsigned portable Windows executable**, not an installer or production release. GitHub workflow artifacts have limited retention.
- UI: floating orange original WPF vector cat, small speech bubble, Done, Snooze, Hide, idle/movement animations, maximized-window placement heuristic.
- Reminder UX: one-off reminders, 10m snooze, Needs Attention inbox, sleep/restart catch-up (15m), tray opt-in autostart.

## Active milestone
**v0.6 — recurrence and editing**. PR #5 on `feature/windows-v0.6-edit-recurrence`; first Windows CI and 49 regression checks passed. Awaiting final merge.

Current status: **v0.6 CI-VERIFIED (49 core checks, x64 compiled), PR #5 pending merge**. Manual lock/wake/voice evidence remains incomplete; not production-ready.

Priority work:
1. Handle presentation failures safely and visibly; do not lose state because a pet popup or speech cannot render.
2. Prevent scheduler failures from silently stopping the app; add private local diagnostics and a clear manual recovery route.
3. Add deterministic tests for time boundaries, multiple reminders, restart/snooze/corrupt storage scenarios.
4. Improve resume/lock safety, avoid spoken alerts on the secure lock screen.
5. Produce new CI-verified unsigned Windows alpha ZIP.

## Known constraints and risks
- The tray **must** remain running. Quitting, force-stop, signing out or shutdown prevents continuous reminders. Optional Windows-startup registration begins it on future login.
- WPF cannot display on Windows' secure lock screen. Sleep/power-off cannot guarantee an exact-time popup.
- NotifyIcon balloons/Windows notifications can be suppressed by OS settings; never call them guaranteed delivery.
- The 15-minute late policy marks much older reminders Missed rather than speaking hours after due time.
- On high DPI, multiple monitors, fullscreen games, text scaling or battery pressure, overlay quality is not yet verified.
- A passing CI build does not prove Windows physical lock/sleep/voice behavior.
- Never store reminder text in diagnostics unnecessarily.

## Release path
- Current CI-verified alpha test build: **v0.6**, unsigned portable Windows x64 artifact `PetPing-Windows-v0.6-unsigned` (artifact ID 12032022285, run 38868473793). v0.5 also passed CI; user confirmed v0.4's floating pet appearance. v0.6 manual laptop QA is open.
- After v0.5: v0.6 daily/weekly repeat, edit reminders and better dashboard; v0.7 expressive characters; v0.8–1.0 Windows packaging/QA; then Android foundation.
- Keep `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/TEST_PLAN.md`, `README.md`, this file and `docs/ENGINEERING_LOG.md` synchronized at milestone boundaries.

## Resume prompt (copy into a new chat)
> Continue the **reminder-pet** project from GitHub `rayadinaveen98-ship-it/reminder-pet`. Read `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` and `docs/ENGINEERING_LOG.md`, check open PRs and the latest CI run, then proceed with the next unchecked milestone. Windows first, Android second; no paid backend. Commit meaningful increments, update handoff docs, verify CI before merging, and distinguish automated build success from actual device testing.

## Implementation progress — v0.5
- ✅ Git continuity: `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` and `docs/ENGINEERING_LOG.md` created and committed to the feature branch.
- ✅ Core changes: storage mutation rollback, crash-safe scheduler fault boundaries + 30s write retry cooldown, local bounded diagnostics, generic tray fallback, speech test, and stopping voice on lock/suspend.
- ✅ Regression tests added for failed writes, diagnostics privacy, multiple same-time IDs.
- ✅ Windows Actions CI run #38864475272 passed: XAML/static checks, 32 smoke checks, x64 EXE publish and artifact upload.
- ✅ GitHub PR #4 merged to `main`; last CI run (docs updated): https://github.com/rayadinaveen98-ship-it/reminder-pet/actions/runs/38864751672 — success, 32 checks, portable ZIP uploaded.
- ⏳ Actual device tests; cannot be marked passed based only on CI.

## v0.6 engineering checkpoint
- Repeating reminders: Daily and Weekly based on local wall time in saved timezone, including DST gaps/ambiguous times.
- Separate persistent occurrence records and atomic next-event creation on delivery/miss, with snooze continuation flag to prevent duplicates.
- Edit ordinary future unsent reminders and adjust repeat settings; previous history stays intact.
- Added deterministic recurrence, DST, long-offline, legacy-file, rollback regression tests. **49 core checks passed** and a Windows artifact was uploaded in GitHub run https://github.com/rayadinaveen98-ship-it/reminder-pet/actions/runs/38868473793 .

## Next action
Merge green PR #5 and confirm the `main` head; distribute `PetPing-Windows-v0.6-unsigned` from GitHub artifact ID 12032022285. Test on Windows: create Daily at a future time, edit an upcoming Weekly reminder, snooze today's repeat and verify tomorrow exists once, close to tray and reopen, verify old saved reminders remain. The v0.5 power/lock QA remains open until evidenced. Then start v0.7 pet expression improvements or follow up P0 defects.
